# Bubble-Pop
Javascript video game, deployed with HTML/CSS
The object of this game is to pop 30 bubbles within 20 seconds.
There are five colours of bubbles; blue, green, yellow, pink and purple.
If you pop a pink bubble, you lose two points. If you pop a purple bubble
the game is over and you lose. The rest of the bubbles increase your score 
by one point when popped.

moving across your screen. To pop one simply move your curser over the bubble.
You have to be quick because the timer is counting down quickly!
